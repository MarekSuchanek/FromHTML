# FromHTML

Simplified API for pure transformation of HTML to other formats with Pandoc in Haskell code.

## Purpose

Pandoc is awesome but using its Haskell API can be a little bit bothersome. This project aims to provide simpler API to transform documents without using monads or even some more advanced magic.
